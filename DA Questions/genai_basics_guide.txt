Generative AI (GenAI) Basics Guide
==================================

What is Generative AI?
----------------------
Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence that can generate new content—like text, images, audio, video, or code—based on data it has learned from.

It uses machine learning models, especially deep learning, to learn patterns from existing data and create something new that resembles it.

Foundational Concepts
---------------------
AI vs Machine Learning vs Generative AI:

| Term               | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Broad field of machines that mimic human intelligence                |
| Machine Learning (ML)        | Subfield of AI that uses data to learn and make predictions         |
| Generative AI                | Subfield of ML that *creates* data instead of just predicting it     |

Example:
- AI: A chatbot that answers questions.
- ML: Predicting tomorrow’s weather.
- GenAI: Creating a new poem or drawing in the style of Shakespeare or Picasso.

Types of Generative Models
--------------------------
Language Models (e.g., ChatGPT): Generate human-like text.

Example:
Prompt: "Write a story about a dragon and a unicorn"
Output: "Once upon a time, in a land filled with misty mountains..."

Image Generators (e.g., DALL·E, MidJourney): Create images from text prompts.
Prompt: “A futuristic city on Mars with flying cars.”

Audio & Music Generators (e.g., Jukebox by OpenAI): Compose music or mimic voices.

Code Generators (e.g., GitHub Copilot): Help programmers by generating code.
Prompt: “Write a Python function to calculate factorial.”

Core Techniques Behind GenAI
----------------------------
Neural Networks: Artificial systems that mimic how the human brain processes information.

Transformers: Architecture used in models like GPT. It understands context and generates meaningful responses.

Training vs Inference:
- Training: Model learns from huge datasets.
- Inference: Model uses what it has learned to generate new content.

Hands-On Examples
-----------------
Using ChatGPT (Text Generation):
Prompt: “Write a short poem about stars.”
Prompt: “Summarize the plot of Harry Potter in 3 sentences.”

Using DALL·E (Image Generation):
Visit https://openai.com/dall-e and try:
Prompt: “An astronaut riding a horse in a futuristic desert.”

Using Google’s MusicLM (Audio Generation):
Prompt: “Jazz music in the style of the 1920s with a modern twist.”
