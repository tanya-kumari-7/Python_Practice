Python Cheat Sheet
This cheat sheet provides a quick reference for common Python syntax and operations.

# Basic Data Types
"""
- Integers: Whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
- Floats: Decimal numbers (e.g., 1.0, 2.5, 3.14)
- Strings: Text (e.g., "Hello, World!")
- Booleans: True or False
"""
# Variables
"""
- Variables are used to store data values.
- In Python, you can create a variable by simply assigning a value to it.
"""
x = 10          # Integer
y = 3.14        # Float
name = "Alice"  # String
is_active = True  # Boolean

# Basic Operations
"""
# Arithmetic Operations
- Addition: x + y
- Subtraction: x - y
- Multiplication: x * y
- Division: x / y
- Modulus: x % y
"""
# Example Arithmetic Operations
sum_result = x + y
sub_result = x - y
mul_result = x * y
div_result = x / y
mod_result = x % y  

# Print results
print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Subtraction:", sub_result)
print("Multiplication:", mul_result)
print("Division:", div_result)
print("Modulus:", mod_result)

# Comparison Operations
"""
- Equal to: x == y
- Not equal to: x != y
- Greater than: x > y
- Less than: x < y
- Greater than or equal to: x >= y
- Less than or equal to: x <= y
"""
# Example Comparison Operations
is_equal = (x == y)
is_not_equal = (x != y)
is_greater = (x > y)
is_less = (x < y)
is_greater_equal = (x >= y)
is_less_equal = (x <= y)
